        <b>Tesla - Excellent Coop Rating</b>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>Josh did a great job in the following: Incorporating feedback from our aero team quickly to add it into his design, learning and adapting to a complicated CAD software and developing competency with it, managing supplier feedback and coming up with clever design for mfg solutions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <b>Verkada - Outstanding Coop Rating</b>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>Josh was tasked with owning the mechanicals on a full NPI program, and was able to drive it to prototype build readiness in a shorter time and with fewer open items than many NPI programs that were staffed with full time engineers. Josh was able to coordinate parallel paths of different design solutions, even under changing project goals and with input from many different cross-functional stakeholders.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>Josh had an extremely successful co-op in a number of categories. His primary project went super well in terms of timeline and build readiness, and as mentioned above he exceeded expectations even for a full-time junior engineer, not to mention a co-op engineer. He is very quick to offer help on tasks large and small, and shows a great deal of independence and ownership once he starts on a project or task. Josh also takes changing requirements and input in stride, and contextualizes those requests in the broader project needs very effectively. In terms of interpersonal aspects of the co-op, Josh fit in great with the rest of the team, and worked well in our 5 day/week in-office environment. </p>

        <b>Kindred AI - Outstanding Coop Rating</b>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>Self-Management - Josh has an impressive level of self- management - he was able take several projects from concept to completion over his 4 month term. Additionally he was able to work on multiple projects at the same time, doing a good job making progress on all of them simultaneously.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>Lifelong learning and career development - Best exemplified by Josh learning a new PLM system within his first couple weeks and helping with a major BOM release. The PLM system was new to the entire team so there were no experts for Josh to lean on. He was able to learn on the go and get the job done. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>Implementation- Josh has a strong ability to bring work to completion. It is common for interns to only take work to the completion of a concept or prototype but he has been able to wrap up projects completely such that there is no handoff required to other team members. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>Team Testimony:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>A great intern. Able to work independently in completing a mission. Always seek out for help when needed and have a good technical intuition on the use of motors. Good assessment on pros/cons for design options. Quick in implementing fixes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>Josh is a hard-working and well-rounded future engineer; he brings positive attitude with him every day. Despite having multiple projects on hand, he has done a great job on following through all of them while also helping the team with time sensitive tasks (e.g. JanBOM release). Josh is a quick-learner and he possesses a healthy amount of both HW and SW aptitudes, which helped him in tackling complicated tasks independently during his short co-op term with the team. Bonus: Overall, I sometimes felt like he is a fully fledged junior engineer. Keep up the diligence and stay inquisitive!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>Josh has displayed excellent communication skills and initiative throughout his internship at Kindred. He is thorough when clarifying tasks/project scope, ensuring he captures all available requirements and information to get started. He clearly communicates how he plans to approach tasks and solicits suggestions when required, creating learning opportunities where he does not have previous experience. Josh regularly provides updates on the status of his work throughout his project by setting up design reviews and constructive feedback sessions to ensure any change in scope is captured and all requirements are met. Upon completion of projects, Josh made planning and development documentation, as well as concise instructions on how the final product will be used by current and future team members.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>Josh is a very quick learner and a truly independent worker who excels at solving problems quickly. When sent off with a problem he may or may not have a solution to, he rarely comes back empty handed, even when the solution might have been outside his area of knowledge. He is not afraid to take on tasks which present themselves as a learning opportunity and is always very receptive of better ways to do a task.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
        <p>Josh has been an absolute pleasure to work with. He is easy to collaborate with, open to feedback, and quick to implement what he's learned. I'm impressed by his ability to work on multiple projects simultaneously and output high quality work. He's made major contributions to the team and we appreciate all his hard work. Hope to work with him again in the future!</p>

    <div class="text-box">
        <p>	Josh set great example what we expect from intern -- great learner, great analytical skill, and great communication.</p>
        <p>	We would love to hire him back to my design team or to the verification team.  I am happy to refer him to other team including neural net team and software team if that's better align with his professional development.</p>
